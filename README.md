# Hangman
Hello there! I am starting up my Hangman project after taking a far too long hiatus. 
I am cheating a bit by taking in some pseudocode from other Hangman projects, putting it into my own words and then outputting the code

This will be the first time I use something like Serialization. In fact, the concept is still rather daunting to me
I will be using JSON for this project, as I find it to be the easiest to grasp. 

I hope to code all of this in a single day, starting today May 23rd, 2023, at exactly 3pm EST
